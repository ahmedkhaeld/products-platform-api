# 6. Integration of Swagger/OpenAPI for API Documentation

Date: 17/07/2024

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Clear and comprehensive API documentation is crucial for developers to understand and interact with the API effectively. Integrating a tool like Swagger/OpenAPI can provide interactive documentation, making it easier for developers to explore and test the API.

## Decision
Integrate Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation and interactive API exploration. Use annotations and decorators to describe API endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.

## Consequences
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Interactive documentation allows developers to test API endpoints directly from the documentation interface, improving the overall developer experience.
- **Consistency**: Annotations and decorators ensure that API documentation is consistently generated based on the code, reducing discrepancies between implementation and documentation.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: With automated documentation generation, maintaining up-to-date documentation becomes easier and less error-prone.
- **Initial Setup**: Integrating Swagger/OpenAPI and adding annotations might require some initial setup and learning effort for the development team.

All decisions will be kept in the /docs/ADL directory.
