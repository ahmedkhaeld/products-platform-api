# 4. Implement Global Exception Filters and Logging

Date: 17/07/2024

## Status
Accepted

## Context
To ensure consistent error handling and logging across the application, it is important to have a standardized approach. This helps in managing exceptions gracefully and provides insights into application behavior and issues.

## Decision
Implement global exception filters to manage and standardize error responses across the API. Additionally, use a logging mechanism to track API activities, debug issues, and monitor performance.

## Consequences
- **Standardized Error Handling**: Global exception filters will provide a consistent structure for error responses, making it easier for clients to handle errors.
- **Improved Debugging**: Logging will help in tracking down issues and understanding application flow, which is crucial for debugging and performance monitoring.
- **Centralized Management**: With a centralized approach, it becomes easier to update and maintain error handling and logging strategies.

All decisions will be kept in the /docs/ADL directory.
